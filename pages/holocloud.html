                                <h3>Where we come from and the current situation ?</h3>
                                <p>I started designing for the web in 2011 and working in 2013. One of my first jobs was at
                                    Microsoft as an intern in their design team located in Helsinki. At that time most of
                                    the resources for UI were made in Photoshop. Yes, Photoshop, a tool for editing photos
                                    was the same for designing web pages. Using this tool, I could export images that were
                                    passed to development and they would do all the magic to bringing it to life through
                                    code. But, they didn't coded it as I expected them to do. The design never fit exactly
                                    what I had designed and it frustrated me, a lot. I didn't understand it, so I decided to
                                    learn how to code frontend, to understand what the problem was and how it could get it
                                    solved.</p>
    
                                <div class="quote">
                                    <p>"we barely mention how incredibly difficult it's to maintain two design systems"</p>
                                </div>
    
                                <h3>Why is this happening?</h3>
                                <p>Many UI designers still keep the graphic design's mindset, as if designing for the web
                                    was the same as designing for offline but with different measures or rules. No, it's not
                                    like that. The medium of the product is totally different and our tools should change
                                    depending on it.</p>
    
                                <p>That is why I believe that the tools we use to design websites should also not be the
                                    same we use to design native mobile apps. They don't work in the same way, they aren't
                                    developed using the same technologies, they don't have the same interactions and they
                                    shouldn't be designed in the same way. SwiftUI has taken the step of being able to
                                    design with the same code used in development, making it the most suitable tool for
                                    designing iOS apps.</p>
