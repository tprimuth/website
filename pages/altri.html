                                    productivity. Currently, remote workers struggle to create physical and/or mental boundaries between work and play within their living spaces, threatening the likelihood of highly productive days.</div>

                                            fit in a backpack or be carried like a laptop, being able to fit any work space anytime anywhere. Altri can be used horizontally as a desktop - with magnets and a comfortable work surface. These magnets are to ease
                                            in workspace transportation, allowing the user to conveniently fasten papers and fold their Altri to easily move to their next location or change its orientation. The Altri fold can also function vertically as a

                                        facing. We used these user feedback to solidify our design direction.
                                        <p>As a team we each conducted several cultural probes with users aged 20 to 45 who are currently working remote, in total we had 11 participants. Our cultural probe consisted of a short packet of questions and drawing prompts for each participant to fill out. Our aim for our cultural probe was to find the reoccurring environmental aspects of the spaces people are working in.
                                        <p>We then wanted to take a deeper dive into our target audiences daily routine and their work environment through user observation. Since this research took place during Covid-19 lock down we conducted all observations via video call. We had each participant set the camera up and then go along with their work day as usual. Our main goal was to establish patterns assessing what is users value the most in a quality work day.</div>
